        Meteorology has been a strong interest of mine since I was
        a kid.  I have always loved studying and observing weather 
        in all its variety. With this passion, I obtained a solid 
        foundation in Meteorology at the University of Utah.
      </p>
      <p className='aboutText'>
        I was privilaged to work as a Meteorologist with great colleagues
        at the Utah Climate Center. While my duties there were deeply rooted
        in the world of science, some also awakened my interest and desire
        to obtain formal training in design and visual communication.
